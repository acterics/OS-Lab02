# Operation Systems and System Programming
## Problem Critical regionThis lab should be done in a team with each student assigned individual item. It is preferable to use the same implementation language by all team members. Supposed implementation languages are Java and C++. Implementation of some items, e.g. 6, in C requires modeling interfaces with structures consisting of function pointers or extensive usage of macros.

Demonstrate race condition on two threads manipulating counter. Use Dekker's algorithm to prevent data corruption. Develop DekkerLock type that provides FixnumLock interface or concept in the case of C++ (see 6). Provide framework that checks if a given locking primitive satisfies mutual exclusion condition. 
Experiment with threads synchronously accessing counter using atomic, spinlock, monitor primitives etc. Utilize java.util.concurrent.Lock interface or Lockable concept to implement benchmarking framework. Implement missing primitives (such as spinlock in Java) and use primitives implemented in 1, 3, 5. Compare performances of different primitives. Try to estimate thread contention.
